## Description
**Python Hangman Game** is a console-based word guessing game. Players attempt to build a word by guessing one letter at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure gets drawn. The player wins if they guess the word before the hangman figure is completed. They lose if the figure is completed first.

**Aim of the Project**: 
To implement a basic text-based game in Python, familiarize with string manipulation, and practice using data structures and user input validation.

**What I Learned**: 
- Game development basics
- String manipulation techniques in Python
- Utilizing Python lists and dictionaries
- Effective handling and feedback of user input 
- Clear instructions and user feedback to ensure an immersive gameplay experience.
- Designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy addition of features or modifications.

## Prerequisites
