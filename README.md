# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

I imported python package, which come in handy to make my code more structured and easy to read.
Created variables  for my game and included variables related to the game.
One of the objectives was to check if the guessed character is in the word, which was I did this by defining 2 functions.
One function iteratively checked if the input is a singular input with just the alphabetical letters.
The other function checked if the input is a character within a word.
I've also refined and optimised my code.
